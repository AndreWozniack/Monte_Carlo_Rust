# Monte Carlo Simulation for Estimating Pi

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of Pi. The simulation generates random points within a unit square and calculates the ratio of points that fall inside a unit circle. This ratio is then used to estimate the value of Pi.

## Overview

The Monte Carlo method is a probabilistic technique that uses random sampling to obtain numerical results. In this project, we use the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of Pi by simulating random points in a square and determining the proportion that falls within a circle inscribed in the square.

## Features

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Generates random points to estimate Pi.
- **Multiple Iterations**: The program runs simulations for various numbers of iterations (100, 10,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 100,000,000).
- **Visualization**: Uses the Plotters library to create visual representations of the points and the estimated circle. Saves the plots as PNG files.
